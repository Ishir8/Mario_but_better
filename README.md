This is a fun arcade game like Mario, with several different Enemies, Decorations and Huge variety of map.

The key feature of this game is this the interesting world Development which makes it hard and very fit for Speed running.

It is also like one of those rage quit games like "Getting over it" as it goes all the way to start on loosing.

Me and my team have used Godot engine to build this game, The sprites have been taken from online assets but the world building and the functionality have been done by us.

Here is the link to the game - https://ishir.itch.io/mad-princ
